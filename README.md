# TypeScript Order Platform -- Microservices (TS_V12_ESBUILD_NPM_MICRO)

Tool-evaluation repository for **Node 12**, bundled with **esbuild**,
managed with **npm**, in a **Microservices** layout.

This is branch **TS_V12_ESBUILD_NPM_MICRO** of the consolidated `typescript-corpus` repository, which holds all 216 TypeScript branches across every Node version, bundler, package manager and architecture combination in this corpus.

## Project type

- **Language:** TypeScript 5.0.4
- **Runtime:** Node 12 (verified against 12.22.12)
- **Scenario:** 2 - Microservices
- **Architecture:** Microservices
- **Module layout:** workspace
- **Bundler:** esbuild 0.21.5 (esbuild transform and linker)
- **Package manager:** npm 8.19.4
- **Source root:** `packages/domain/src`

Node 12 is end-of-life, and that is deliberate: it pins the entire toolchain to
the last release of each tool that still supports it. Every version in this
repository was resolved against the live npm registry and then executed on a
real Node 12.22.12 interpreter. None was written from memory.

## Build

```bash
npm i -g npm@8.19.4
npm ci
npm run build
npm run bundle
```

`npm run build` type-checks with `tsc --noEmit` and emits CommonJS + declarations to
`dist/`; `npm run bundle` then bundles with **esbuild 0.21.5 (esbuild transform and linker)** and **executes the bundle**.
Emitting is not proof; running it is.

## Run

```bash
node dist/packages/domain/src/index.js
```

Each service is independently runnable:

```bash
node dist/services/gateway-service/src/index.js
node dist/services/pricing-service/src/index.js
```

## Test

```bash
npm run test        # mocha over tests/
npm run coverage    # c8 (primary) AND nyc + ts-node (cross-check)
```

Both coverage tools must report non-zero. They deliberately disagree: c8 reads
V8 coverage of the emitted output and remaps it, while nyc instruments the
TypeScript AST directly through `ts-node/register`. Identical numbers would mean
one of them is not an independent second opinion.

`nyc` here never reports through a source-map remap. Doing so silently yields
0% -- the file is remapped to `.ts`, an `--include` written against `dist/**`
stops matching, and the report empties while the process still exits 0.

## Architecture

**Microservices.** Three independently deployable services over a shared domain
package, wired through a workspace root.

```
packages/
  domain/         @orderkit/domain     -- models, services, analysis fixtures
  contracts/      @orderkit/contracts  -- inter-service message types
services/
  gateway-service/    accepts payloads, emits order.submitted
  order-service/      validates and prices, emits order.priced / order.rejected
  pricing-service/    owns tier and volume rates (leaf -- calls no one)
```

Each service has its own `package.json`, its own `src/index.ts` entry point and
its own start script. The workspace root lists them under `workspaces`.

**Documented inter-service call path:**

```
http.request -> gateway-service -> order.submitted
                order-service   -> pricing.quote -> pricing-service
                pricing-service -> pricing.rate  -> order-service
                order-service   -> order.priced | order.rejected
```

This matters because of what the JavaScript corpus got wrong: FlintAtlas's sheet
said `Microservices` while the repository was a flat monolith with no
workspaces, and its own README and `dataset.json` both said "monolith". Nothing
in that repo compared the two. Here `Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/full_check.ts` fails the build if the
declared architecture and the actual layout disagree.


## Tool test-data folders

This repo carries only `Tool Invalid (Synthetic Data)/` from testable-platform/typescript-corpus's original per-branch task-data folders.

### `Tool Invalid (Synthetic Data)/`
Same shape as Clean -- 40 tools, the same 5-Node-version pattern, and the same
covgate exception -- but engineered so every fixture makes the tool flag or
fail rather than pass: the **Tool Invalid** condition. Only covgate's 6 git
histories needed bundling here (`_git-bundles/` + `restore-git.ps1`, alongside
an earlier `restore-covgate-git.ps1` left in place from a prior pass);
`diff-cover`'s and `pydriller`'s Invalid fixtures were already plain,
git-free copies.
